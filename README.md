# &#x1f42f; Clemson Game Coding Camp &#x1f42f;
Clemson Game Coding Camp is a two-week camp for high school students and rising seniors on the autism spectrum (ASD) that exposes them to high-level video game development and networking with peers. Throughout the two-week camp, campers learn the high-level processes of software development, game development, interpersonal communication, collaboration, and end up with their own game, from scratch.    

We are excited to host this camp for the second year in a row. This year, our two-week coding camp will be provided in two formats, virtual through Zoom and in-person (on the Clemson University campus). Students may participate fully online, fully in-person, or choose one week to be online and the other week to be in-person. It is recommended that students register for both weeks. 

In addition to learning to code, students who reside on campus will participate in activities and instruction designed to further develop their executive functioning, problem-solving, and self-advocacy skills, which are necessary for college success.


## 2021 Camp Dates:  
Week 1 Monday, June 14 through Friday, June 18, 2021   
Week 2 Monday, June 21 through Friday, June 25, 2021

The Zoom virtual sessions will run from 12:30 - 3:30pm EST Monday through Friday. The in-person students will have morning instruction related to college readiness and coding sessions from 12:30 - 3:30pm EST Monday through Friday.
